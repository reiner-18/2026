Today, I replace the old method when I learning at school about learning English, instead learn with Vietnamese Teacher to "lấy lại gốc" I changed to learn English with Bob the Canadian. How I decided it ?

So, I think I need to try something new in new year. So I search "How to learn English from Scratch" and I see him, about 3.2 milion view. I very excited, after that, I click this video youtube recommend and I saw this. Currently, Bob sharing the road map for free, my job is find the task, documentation to enjoy this.

I don't need to dive into grammar in the first time when I start the foreign language. So I learn how to speak, and try to hear and understand foreign people say.
