So today I have changed my blog about RAM, I split my root blog to 2 blogs. Main blog is overview about RAM, DRAM and SRAM, talk about different between it. 

Why I do it ? Because I realize I have some topic in my blog duplicate content and I can't keep consistency in my blog.

And DRAM have so many topic to dicuss. DRAM traning, Row Hammer, Bank, Memory-Level Parallelism, ... and some technical how to create it.

I want to understand ASML and TSMC what they are create and samsung. Whatever, I think in my journey discovery, I will find it.
