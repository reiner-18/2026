Today, I was completed my blog overview about RAM. I rewrite topic history of RAM and some old technology. I think this chapter is better than old blog. I try to old chapter in one blog and this is sucks, it duplicate and I cannot control it.

My plan to return university is none plan. I think I will research computer along time before switch finance career. If I want to rich, I need to go to school and learn about how finance work. And computer is side research for my life. I remember when I asked AI heap and stack and I don't understand why I need to learn the concept and why it created. And I dive in physical floor. the transistor, selectron, old technical but I can understand why at present, why them created it and what they solve problem is ?. That why I don't go to school and learn about computer science. I will make money and research the computer, coding and use computer to solve problem in my life.
