Today, I started learn pointer from scratch. Honestly, I never think I will choose pointer to my point when I start learning coding. But I know if I want to learning Rust, or something else about low level programming, I need to dive into concept pointer. The first thing I need to understand is Heap and Stack.

In the morning. I was dream, I saw my first love. Let me tell you story. She is lesbian - I heard from my friend. She wish she become a US police. I very respect her dream but I can't understand why she have a big love for US. When I started meet her. I don't she is a excellent student - 1st ranking in my school. Until she have gift from principal.

I watched anime with her, she and me was intimate and watch - yeb, I very childlike. But in the present. I hate anime very much. I think Anime for children, and I try to become a adult - Teenager rebel, you know. 5 years ago, she flied to US. Since, I never meet her.

On facebook or any social network, she don't public favorite like she live in VietNam. I think she have new joy, so I don't have common point to connect.
