Today, I thinking about a plan for learn Java and make a real product enterprise. I don't know how to start and where I can learn it. Road map, or mentor to teach me what I should learn. I remember my friend. He worked at FPT for Japan department, he said me "you don't need to learn DSA to make product, I don't know set map or dynamic programming and I still working", Also, he level up to product manager. I don't know why they don't need it and I think I can do it. But I have a scare is fear of missing out. Honesty, this is big problem make me can not start.

Java is great, long syntax but I see the beautiful if I write code clean. Difference C++, I can use C++ for CP and write code in routine. Java will make me focus and make a product reality to show HR what I can do and where my ranking.

Garbage Collections is main point of Java, this feature make Java famous because strong security. This is explain why Java use at enterprise or banking. so I think I will make app mini like bank app or online judge or something else. I don't know what I need to do and currently I feel vague.
