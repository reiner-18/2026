Today, I was broke my UI in Arch Linux, I can not fix it because my knowledge is not enough. A litte bug very small but I make me feel uncomfortable. Gnome can not read dis capacity but fastfetch know. So I think I was test UI and install something stupid. That sucks.

Today, I was playing game very much. Because If I don't playing game, I will burn out. I wolk every day and I don't relax. So I decided dive into with TFT. AOV and eat very much.

Currently. my laptop very find. But I god this error so I so unlike and I want to fit quickly. I try to solve problem with ChatGPT but I don't revieve a good result. I though should I reinstall OS. ??

I think anwser will get tomorrow. I want to sleep. My eye want to close and I can not brainstorming. I write this daily note with half eye. But I can write. That a good signal, right ?
