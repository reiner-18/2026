I'm thinking, currently, I'm want to sleeping, I don't know have story to talk in today. I'm thinking about Java, when I can start. I very busy and tired to begin because I working 11 hours of day. I want to start to day but I'm boring because I learn from scratch so many.

I started learn coding 2 year ago. But I'm not serious like when I learn rubik's cube. My ego so high and I'm not listen my teacher. I don't know why I do that at present. Also, I'm very lazy, honestly, I learn because I fomo so I can not get a good result.

I look at my future, if I don't study right now, I can not make money, truthly, I like coding because it seem like solve rubik cube. but yeah, my ego so high so I was broken my future. That why I can not start.

I don't want to remember but if when I study, I have a feel it. A feel of ego, I scare mistake, I scare to lose everyone so I can not learn anything. That's it. This is my story I try to tell with my self.
