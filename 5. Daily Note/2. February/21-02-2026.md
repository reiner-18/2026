Today, at the end of night, I was cry, I cry because my past is not good, I cry because I lost my friend. I need to go inside of my mind and handle it. I don't want to avoid it. I need to close my past and go ahead.

At present, I don't want to write daily note, but this is my habit I practice and I don't want to remove it. So I write this line. Something I feel tired but I need to go to the future.

I play the rubik cube. I love it. I can feel time stop when I solve problem. I love this and I want to be better than present. I want to be sub 10. I want to be a good programmer. write code like artist. I will shut down my laptop right now, this is the end of day and I want to close it.
