Today, I was built my plan for practice rubik's cube effective more. I want to become sub 10 like Yiheng Wang. But I need to solve my problem is I can not keep consistency in practice. My goats start 16s and end in 11s. It's very sucks and I want to fix it.

I think I will learn PLL from different way, after that I learn OLL and understand how the conner and edge move in algorithm. And I will learn about pseudo cross. Yes, it's very hard but I need to learn to become pro cube.

I keep my habit is solve problem in codeforce 7 days. I try to building a good habit and I think I will success.
