Happy new year, today, I'm alone but I not solitary because I have my friend, my friend have me a lot and they will companion with me. I think I will setup tracking habit in the morning tomorrow. and here is why.

I want to control my self, I need to follow my progress to see how I work. I refer the model PDCA or Kanban, I think this is the best way to start control your life

I write note equal English because I want to learn English but I can not study at school. Some reasons but the main reasons is I don't like school, they are to rigid

I want to learn Rust instead Java very much, I don't know why but I think if I master it, I can make money and build something interested to solve something problem in my life.
