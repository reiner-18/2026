I have plan for sub 10 rubik cube but currently my rubik cube is very bad. Something I need to turn fast and I get lock on layer three. I make a mistake is I forgot lube.

I need to improve my F2L, let me explain my bad point in solution.

I cannot see first F2L after I complete cross - that very hard, and finger tricks so bad. I realize if I have good finger trick after I solve cross, I will saw the first F2L and I can get sub 12 and sub 10.

So I think after I get money, I will buy Gan cube or Moyu cube, I love both but I must be choose one because finance say I don't have money.
