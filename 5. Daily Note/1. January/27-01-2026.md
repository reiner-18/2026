Today, I was login in Codeforce and solve problem on it. This is the first time I touch about keyboard and write the code. One year later, I was playing and hate code, hate everything in my life until my friend lie me, he get all my money and I realize, I don't have anything, I have my self and rubik's cube. So I return my favorite, and learn something new. I remember my ego, it's destroy my. I off my university and play, just play. That sucks. and I learn everything from scratch with youtube and AI.

Rubik's cube is my motivation. I solve problem and I forgot time and everything around me. I don't realize my brain is sleep to long and it is need to active.
