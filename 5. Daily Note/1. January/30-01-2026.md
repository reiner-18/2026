Today, I feel so bad, because both SSD was broken. I can't write or read sector anything and I lost all my data. It's not important but this is old lecture I save in my data. I can learn all knowledge in youtube but I feel I was lost something. 

I was thinking about quantitative math for trading stock. yeb I get idea from Jim Simons. I need to get more and more money to buy something like clothes, rubik's cube and discovery world and more experience.

I want to need tranning for new habit. About health, some execrise like kegel, plank, and more like read the book and research about the content why it was born. I hope I will success because I success the habit is write daily note every day.

Everyday, I try to complete one problem in codeforce and submit. I think it will make me create habit and yeah. That is a good habit.
