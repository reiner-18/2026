Today, I was do some problem in Codeforce with 800 points. Some problem make me feel difficult and I was skip it. Yeah, I don't want to pay my time to problem I can not solve it. It't make me two hours and I was solve the rubik's cube to kill my time.

I thinking why I don't research about The Prince, about context and Nicolo Machiavelly, I want to know about the history and how to book was born. A want to build my power, and become the prince with empire. But I'm lazy to read my book. If I have pdf. I will read because I familiar my phone and I don't asleep if I watch in phone screen.

Some book I want to read if I complete The Prince. Come as you are, Ho Truong Khu Co, The God Father. And one people I want to research is Jim Simons. The investment quite in market. So, after I complete my book, 3 books. I will learn math and something else relate to finance.
