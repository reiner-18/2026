Today, I decided to return programming, the first topic I choose is find sub array.

I remember when I help my friend to goat interview and I the execrises find sub array and this is my weak point. I don't understand how I can display all sub array with loop. That is my hole knowledge.

I decided to learn from scratch with rubik's cube alg. I learn from U perm and with CP, I choose sub array, prefix sum, two pointer and this is foundation before I dive into it.

I don't know why I love competitive game. The rubik's cube and programming, I think it similar, learn algorithms, and one problem have so many solution. Basically, it's make me fun, the feel winning is great.
