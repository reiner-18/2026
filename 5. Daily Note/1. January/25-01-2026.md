Today, I was go outside with my friend, and I have some problem in hole time is the fashion.

I don't know how to mix color in clothes, so many choose in my eye and I can not choose one shirt or trousers. Uniqlo is the best choice for learning mix clothes. They have basic color and I very excited when I come in to shop. 

I want to join to competitive programming, but I need to learning what I need to start, what I need to learn, two pointer, search, find, recursion - this is my week point because I can not thinking about it. I learn algorithms rubik's cube very easily but in programming, I have choose C or C++ to learning CP.

I love the C language because I can understand behind from malloc function but C++ not, it is use new to use heap and so many overload in C++. And C is 'less is more' that why I love it.
