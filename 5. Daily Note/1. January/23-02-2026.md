Today, I solve rubik's cube and got personal record is 10.33s, I was build plan for learn about algorithm but I'm lazy. I think I will learn about U perm at first. After learn all PLL, I will learn full oll after that.

I have trouble is my data in old SSD and I need to get data early. My lesson, about technical programming, two pointer, sub array - this is the hard problem and I can not understand it.

I get my old book is The Prince of Machiavelli. This is the first book I want to read all and once again, I'm lazy. I hope the value of the book is good for my self and for my future. I bought the book two year ago but I read half. So many thing I need to complete.
