Today, I was help my friend about contest to apply to NAB. I try to complete it and first two problems is easy, I can handle it. But my friend is understand what I'm thinking about algorithm and time complexity.

I try to explain but he doesn't care about algorithm, he take care about product, code base in enterprise and he is try to avoid algorithm. I really sad to thinking about developer doesn't care about efficiency.

But I haven't try to solve problem in leetcode 6 month ago. I can say I don't touch computer during time. But I still remember mark array, about sort, and can explain why alg this can fast alg that. That is it. If he get a offer from NAB, I think I will return algorithm anh practice it.
