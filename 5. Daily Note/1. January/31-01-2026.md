Today, I was decided to buy a new shoe is Saucony Peregrine 14. Let me tell you why I buy it.

The first thing is it fit to me and Mizuno so large. Mizuno I feel so comfortable and it's so soft. Yeah, I rating the Mizuno shoe high.

Saucony Peregrine 14 is fit. It's sturdy, and it's for trail. Yes I use saucony to walk every day. I seem like you use a road car and run in city. So big and not fit context. But saucony have style make me love. A little bit big but thin. And one more thing is it is fit. so I buy it.

I was complete 3 problem in codeforce in 30 minutes. Oh my god. I never think I can be do that but I done. That is very good - This is journey I practice for my new habit.
